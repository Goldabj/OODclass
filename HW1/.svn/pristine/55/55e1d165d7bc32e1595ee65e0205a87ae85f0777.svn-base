	 * twoEven(3,2,6) returns true because 2 and 6 are even
	 * twoEven(2,4,6) returns false because all three are even, not just 2
	 * twoEven(3,99,100) returns false because only 100 is even

	 * Hint: take a look at section 5.7 in your textbook for some more
	 * examples of boolean functions like AND and NOT.  The rest of chapter
	 * 5 might be good too if you're a bit confused.
	 * 
	 * Be sure to add appropriate Javadoc comments for your function
